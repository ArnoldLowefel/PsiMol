# PsiMol
Project repository for ADP 2024.

The main goal of this project is to create a lightweight Python plugin for [psi4 package](https://psicode.org) for automated reading, conversion and basic molecular operations on chemical formats, including xyz, mol and (most importantly) SMILES.

It may as well enable some standalone transformations of molecules, including adding explicit hydrogens, mutating atoms/bonds and getting basical chemical properties (like molar mass or total charge), and parsing between the above file formats.

Additional, minor task would include implementing visualizations of obtained molecules.
